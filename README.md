# Career-PathFinder-Data-Preparation
 
Requires R 4.2.2 (2022-10-31)
Running Windows x86_64

To run this project from your machine, follow these instructions:
1. Install the `renv` package.
2. Fork this repo
3. Open this project in an R session.
4. You should be asked if you want to download and install the packages this project needs to run using `renv::restore()`

For more information on `renv` visit [renv's website](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html).

To prevent private employee information from being available on Github, a separate file containing historical personnel transactions has been omitted from this repo.  You will need to contact the repo owner for the file and place it under a new folder.  The file path should ultimately look like this `input/taps.RDS`.  Note that the folder name is `input` and is at the project root level.  

Run the shiny app from R Studio and you should be able to process the text files.
